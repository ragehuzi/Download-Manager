## üì• Multi-threaded Download Manager

This is a **C-based** multi-threaded download manager that allows fast and efficient downloading of files from direct URLs using multiple threads.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **C Language**: Core implementation language for system-level performance and memory control.
* **libCURL**: Used for handling the downloading of files over various protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) via direct URLs.
* **POSIX Threads (Pthreads)**: Used to implement multi-threading, allowing concurrent downloading to increase speed and responsiveness.
* **Thread Synchronization**: Mutexes and other POSIX synchronization primitives are used to ensure thread-safe operations and avoid race conditions during download and file writing.

### ‚úÖ Features

* Supports **multi-threaded** downloads using direct URLs.
* Efficient and faster downloading through thread-based chunk management.
* Uses **libCURL** for robust and reliable downloading.
* Thread-safe implementation with **POSIX thread synchronization**.
* Lightweight and written entirely in **C** for portability and performance.
